<img src="./assets/images/reilly-colours.png" style="margin: 0;">

**List of colors used are:**
* #F7D165 Orange Yellow Crayola
* #555F7B Independence
* #FFFFFF White

The predominant color used for this website was Independence apart from the mainbackground colour of white. 
This was chosen to provide a nice contrast with the various images used and maintain a dominant look and feel.

#### Fonts

The main font used for this website was **Roboto** with **Sans Serif** as a backup font. Apart from the main logo text which was **Roboto Slab** to give
the title matching style to the font style on the main image of the Home page.

Font weights used were:
* 300
* 400
* 600


### Wireframes

With the help of [figma](https://www.figma.com/) I produced mockups of the proposed website starting with a mobile first approach.

Links to the mockups can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/B83dqKY1SnY79mZndsN8KZ/Reillys-Honey-Farm?node-id=0%3A1) where you will find the full design 
proposal for each page. I tried my best to adhere to the inital proposal only changing things if seen as an additional improvement to the overall
website.

## 2. Features

### Existing Features

#### Home Page

* **Layout and Style**
    * I want the website to give the user a great first impression the minute they open the page. I feel the choice of image used GIF used 
    on the Home page achieves this. Although the GIF was originally a video I replaced it so as to enhance the user experience and not have them 
    possibly waiting for the video to load on startup. 
    I added a clear paragraph on its own under the image to ensure the user a better feel of what is involved within the website 
    * Any text used was to give clear decisive information about the images it was next too, general information and also for directions on how to use 
    the interactive Honey Jar page. 
    * Careful detail was applied to the responsiveness of the site to further ensure all retail space sized correctly and not leaving any blank areas. A lot 
    of attention was put into this through the use of media queries.

* **Navigation Bar**
    * The navigation bar has a fixed position on all pages to allow for easy constant use. 
    * On small screen widths the navbar items reduce to a toggler icon that provides them with a dropdown list when clicked.
    * The Indepenence color was used on the navbar to keep in touch with the overall theme of the Website, with the addition of a bee logo
    to always give that feel of where you are.
    * The "Sign Up" button on the Navbar allows users to sign up to the website with their email in order to receive a monthly newsletter 
    about any offers that may arise.

* **Footer**
    * Contact information: 
        * For now the contact links have been solely dependant on the social media links. There will be plans in the future to add 
        additional contact information.
    * Social section provides links to all relevant social media sites (currently linked to login pages of each)
    * The Orange Yellow Crayola colour of the social links changes to Russian Violet on hover in order to give the user a sense of what icon they are on..

* **Home**
    * The Home page consists of information about the different hive locations and where they can be found via an interactive map from Google. Once the 
    user hovers over the map markers the location will popup next to it.

* **Progressing**
    * I have then included a button to the bottom of the page as well as the navbar to lead people onto the Honey page. The purpose of this was 
    to provide a better flow through the website.


#### Honey & Quiz

**Honey**
* I wanted the site to be as user friendly as possible as well as always giving the user a sense of what is going on. This is achieved by displaying
the Honey Jar been filled by the required amount selected by the user from each hive location.
* Should they make an error and over-fill the Jar the Jar will then empty and reset ready to be filled again.
**Quiz**
* A Quiz was added to the bottom of the page prior to what will be the "checkout" to give the user a chance of winning a discount on their Honey.
* In addition this also provides the user with some better understanding about bees.


### Features left to implement

* Different Languages - While the website is full of visual information I would still like to be able to implement a list of countries so the website would display 
all text in a language native to that country as international shipping can become an option.
* Checkout - At the moment once the quiz is complete a modal will return you to the Home page. In time this will instead lead onto a checkout page
for purchasing of the Honey. 
* Tracking - I would like to install analytical tools to properly monitor how much traffic the website gets at different times of the year.


### Plans for future releases

* Expansion - I would like to offer up the website to other Bee-Keepers as a way for them to be able to generate business.
* Social Media - The current social media links are only general links to login pages. I want to have relevant information on those links further expanding Reillys Honey Farm business.
* Contact - There will be increased ways for users and businesses to contact us.
